********  CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO THE INTERNET AND THE WORLD WIDE WEB  ******


Group A
1. Define the term “Protocol” in the context of the Internet.
= A protocol refers to a standardized set of rules and procedures that govern how data is transmitted and received over
the Internet. These rules ensure that different devices, such as computers and servers, can communicate correctly by defining
data format, timing, error handling, and transmission methods.

2. Differentiate between a Web Browser and a Search Engine.
= A web browser is an application software used to access and display web pages on the Internet, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla 
Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
A search engine, on the other hand, is an online service or website that helps users locate information by searching through 
indexed web pages using keywords, for example Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo.

3. Explain the World Wide Web (WWW).
= The World Wide Web (WWW) is a vast system of interconnected web pages and websites that are accessed through the Internet. 
These web pages are linked using hyperlinks and are viewed using web browsers. The WWW allows users to access text, images, 
videos, and other multimedia resources globally.

4. Compare static web pages and dynamic web pages.
= A static web page delivers the same fixed content to every user and does not change unless manually updated by the developer. 
It is usually created using HTML and CSS.
A dynamic web page generates content in real time based on user interaction, database content, or server-side processing.
Technologies such as PHP, JavaScript, and databases are commonly used to create dynamic pages.

Group B: Long Answer Questions
5. Explain the client–server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
= Client–server architecture is a network model in which tasks are divided between service providers (servers) and service 
requesters (clients). The client is typically a user’s web browser, while the server is a powerful computer that stores websites, 
applications, and data.

When a user enters a website URL, the browser sends a request to the web server using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS. 
The server processes this request, retrieves the required resources, and sends the response back to the client. The browser 
then displays the received content to the user.

Neat Diagram (Text Representation):

+----------------+        Request        +----------------+
|  Client (User) |  ------------------>  |  Web Server    |
|  Web Browser   |                       | (Stores Data)  |
|                |  <------------------  |                |
+----------------+        Response       +----------------+


This architecture improves performance, security, and scalability by separating user interaction from data processing.

6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services.
a) Email

Email is an Internet service that enables users to send and receive electronic messages instantly. It supports text communication 
as well as file attachments such as documents, images, and videos, making it a widely used tool for personal and professional
 communication.

b) FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

FTP is a protocol used for transferring files between a client computer and a remote server. It is commonly used for uploading
 website files, downloading data, and managing server directories in web hosting environments.

c) VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)

VoIP allows voice and video communication over the Internet instead of traditional telephone networks. Services like Zoom, 
Skype, and WhatsApp calls use VoIP technology, offering cost-effective and flexible communication.

7. “The Internet is a network of networks.” Justify this statement and explain packet switching.

The Internet is described as a network of networks because it is formed by connecting millions of smaller networks worldwide, 
including private, public, academic, and government networks. These networks are interconnected using standardized protocols.

To transmit data efficiently, the Internet uses a technique called packet switching. In this method, data is broken into small 
packets that travel independently through various network paths. Once they reach the destination, the packets are reassembled
in the correct order. This approach increases speed, reliability, and efficient use of network resources.

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions
8. Startup website scenario

= In this case, choosing a static website is the most appropriate decision for the startup. The website only needs to present 
uniform information such as company background, services offered, contact details, and basic product information. There is no 
need for user accounts, real-time data processing, or database interaction.
Static websites are developed using simple technologies like HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, which makes them easy to design 
and deploy. They are cost-effective to host and require minimal maintenance, making them ideal for startups operating with 
limited financial resources.
Additionally, static websites offer faster loading speeds since pages are pre-built and directly served to users. This improves 
user experience and contributes positively to search engine optimization (SEO). Security risks are also lower because there is 
no server-side processing or database to exploit.
Therefore, considering affordability, speed, simplicity, and security, a static website is the most practical solution for the
startup.


9. Google website error scenario

= The issue described in this scenario is caused by a failure in the Domain Name System (DNS).

DNS functions as a directory service that converts domain names (such as www.google.com
) into numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate. When a website opens using its IP address but not through 
its domain name, it indicates that the web server is active but the DNS resolution is not working correctly.

Possible reasons for this issue include:

- DNS server malfunction

- Incorrect DNS configuration

- Corrupted DNS cache on the user’s device

- Expired or misconfigured domain registration

- Due to DNS failure, the browser cannot locate the server using the domain name, even though the server itself is operational. 
Resolving the issue may involve flushing the DNS cache, changing DNS servers, or correcting DNS settings.


10. Appropriate network type for sharing sensitive data with suppliers

= An Extranet is the most suitable network type for sharing sensitive company data with external suppliers. An Extranet 
allows limited and controlled access to authorized external users while maintaining high security standards.

It extends an organization’s Intranet by providing access through authentication mechanisms such as usernames, passwords, 
and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). This ensures that confidential data remains protected and accessible only to trusted partners.

Benefits of using an Extranet include:

- Secure data sharing with authorized suppliers

- Restricted and monitored access

- Enhanced collaboration and communication

- Protection of sensitive business information

- Unlike the public Internet or internal-only Intranet, an Extranet provides the right balance between accessibility and security. Hence, it is the most appropriate solution for this scenario.
